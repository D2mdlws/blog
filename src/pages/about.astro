    <h2>Who Am I</h2>
    <p>
      A fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University. I used to be interested in architecture and operating systems, but later transitioned to computer vision and embodied AI.
    </p>

    <h2>My Tech Stack</h2>
    <p>
      My coding skills have seriously declined. Languages I've written a significant amount in include C, C++, Python, and Verilog; I took a Java course and almost failed; I once fudged a distributed VPN assignment using linked lists instead of blockchain in Go; and during a summer internship, I wrote CUDA and TensorFlow fusion operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current research direction is Computer Vision + Embodied AI. I am currently reading papers related to VPR (Visual Place Recognition) and attempting to reproduce some SOTA methods. I feel the next three years will be exceptionally busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for why my direction has changed so drastically, I'll write about it when I'm in the mood. This year's life plan has encountered multiple twists and turns, making it quite complicated.
